      <p>
        I am Xinke Chen, webmaster and author of this blog you're currently on
        right now. I have a B.S. Computer Science from the University of
        Pittsburgh with a Minor in Economics. As you might expect, I care quite
        about technology, specifically, in experimenting with it. In my journey
        in becoming a better software engineer, I have played with and tried to
        learn quite a few different frameworks, languages and ecosystems. From
        iOS with Objective-C and Swift, to PostgreSQL and Vue with JavaScript,
        my curiosity with technology and software is quite diverse.

        Beyond just computers, I also love photography and specifically, astro
        and night landscapes. Again, along with the theme of experimenting (and
        also as a constraint of my location), I like these type of subjects
        specifically to see how far I push the camera technically, to see what
        even the eye can't see. There's something special in capturing something
        that otherwise would not exist were it not for the presence and ability
        of the camera.
